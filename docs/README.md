# OpenQEMIST documentation

The documentation is built with `sphinx` and `sphinx-apidoc`. To build the
documentation run
```bash
make html
```
to build the HTML documentation.  The output files will be found in `_build/html`.
The makefile does a few things more than the default generated by Sphinx. It also runs
```bash
sphinx-apidoc  -o refman/ .. ../setup.py ../openqemist/tests/ ../benchmarks
```
to generate the reference manual and it also converts the [Jupyter notebook](../examples/end_to_end.ipynb)
to reStructuredText, and embeds it into the documentaton.
This requires that the notebooks can run fully with no errors.

To add new Jupyter notebooks to the documentation, follow the pattern in the [Makefile](./Makefile) to convert the notebook and move the rst file, then add an entry to the [index](./index.rst) to show it in the sidebar.
