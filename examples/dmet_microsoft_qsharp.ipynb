    "One of the main objectives of quantum chemistry calculations in the area of materials science is to solve the electronic structure problem, $H\\Psi=E\\Psi$, as accurately as possible, in order to accelerate the materials design process. Here we solve the problem for the molecule shown below. \n",
    "<img src=\"img/exact.png\" alt=\"exact\" width=\"200\" />\n",
    "The computational cost for performing accurate calculations of the electronic structure of molecules, however, is usually very expensive. For example, the cost of performing the full CI calculation scales exponentially on a classical computer as the size of the system increases. Therefore, when we target large-sized molecules, those relevant for industry problems, it becomes essential to employ an appropriate strategy for reducing the computational cost, while maintaining accuracy, when performing electronic structure calculations. One such strategy is to decompose a molecular system into its constituent fragments and its environment, for each fragment independently, as appropriate for the problem. First, the environment outside of a fragment is calculated using a less-accurate method than will be used to calculate the electronic structure of a fragment. Then, the electronic structure problem for a given fragment is solved to a high degree of accuracy, which includes the quantum mechanical effects of the environment. The quantum mechanical description is updated (i.e., solved iteratively as shown below) by incorporating the just-performed highly accurate calculation. In the following schematic illustration, the molecule shown above is decomposed into fragments. Each molecular fragment CH$_\\mathrm{3}$ and CH$_\\text{2}$ are the fragments chosen for the electronic structure calculation, with the rest of the molecular system being the surrounding environment.\n",

    "One successful decomposition approach is the DMET method$^{1,2}$. The DMET method decomposes a molecule into fragments, and each fragment is treated as an open quantum system that is entangled with each of the other fragments, all taken together to be that fragment's surrounding environment (or \"bath\"). In this framework, the electronic structure of a given fragment is obtained by solving the following Hamiltonian, by using a highly accurate quantum chemistry method, such as the full CI method or a coupled-cluster method.\n",

The quantum mechanical effects from the environment are incorporated through the one-particle term of the Hamiltonian. The extra term $\\mu\\sum_{r}^{\\text{frag}} a_{r}^{\\dagger}a_{r}$ ensures, through the adjustment of $\\mu$, that the number of electrons in all of the fragments, taken together, becomes equal to the total number of electrons in the entire system."

    "Here we provide examples of the performance results of DMET calculations (using classical simulation), employing some organic hydrocarbons (C$_{n}$H$_{n}$), below: tetrahedrane (C$_{4}$H$_{4}$, top left), prismane (C$_{6}$H$_{6}$, top centre), cubane (C$_{8}$H$_{8}$, top right), cuneane (C$_{8}$H$_{8}$, bottom left), pentaprismane (C$_{10}$H$_{10}$, bottom centre), and diademane (C$_{10}$H$_{10}$, bottom right). In these examples, each fragment consists of only one atom, thereby largely reducing the size of the electronic structure problem to be solved. Of the several electronic structure solvers used in DMET calculation we select the CCSD method (as it is the one most commonly used), the Meta-L&ouml;wdin as the localization scheme, and cc-pVDZ as the basis set.

    "It is also possible to estimate the quantum resources required based on the classical DMET calculations shown above. For pentaprismane, shown in an example classical simulation (see Section 2-B), DMET calculation requires 56 qubits, whereas 380 qubits are necessary for CCSD calculation of the full system. Thus, the DMET method can be a powerful tool for greatly reducing the computational resources needed."
