    "This tutorial assumes that the user has correctly set up and configured the OpenQEMIST package. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)$^{1,2}$ is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating quantum systems. We here focus on VQE within the context of solving the molecular electronic structure problem for the ground-state energy of a molecular system. In VQE, we first prepare the trial wavefunction (quantum state) $\\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle = U(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert 0 \\rangle$ based on an ansatz that depends on $m$ parameters defining $\\vec{\\theta}=(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\ldots, \\theta_m)$. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian ($\\hat{H}$), $\\langle \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert \\hat{H} \\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle$, will then be simulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The expectation value can be minimized based on the variational principle,  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "E = \\min_{\\vec{\\theta}} \\frac{\\langle \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert \\hat{H} \\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle}{\\langle \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle} \\geq E_{\\text{gs}}\\nonumber\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which ensures that the energy computed will be an upper bound to the true ground-state energy $E_{\\text{gs}}$. This allows us using classical minimizers to find optimal parameters $\\vec{\\theta}$ for the ground-state energy $E_{\\text{gs}}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "VQE can be performed using OpenQEMIST in conjuction with Qiskit for calculating the ground state energy of a molecular system. Unitary coupled-cluster ansatz can be used to prepare the trial wavefunction $\\vert \\Psi(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle$. In this notebook, we will show you an example using a small molecule, the hydrogen molecule (H$_\\text{2}$), for a simulation using VQE. "
