# OpenQEMIST
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/1QB-Information-Technologies/openqemist.svg?token=zt4rNJ8MTUGcpVsToGyy&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/1QB-Information-Technologies/openqemist)

Harnessing the combined power of emerging quantum computing technologies and
state-of-the-art classical techniques, the Quantum-Enabled Molecular ab Initio
Simulation Toolkit, or QEMIST, is 1QBitâ€™s innovative solution to a fundamental
and intractable problem in chemistry: ab initio simulation of molecules.

QEMIST is designed to enable the accurate calculation of molecular properties by
leveraging advanced problem decomposition (PD) techniques and quantum computing.
The variety of PD techniques implemented in QEMIST enables massively parallel
simulations by breaking down a computational chemistry task into smaller,
independent subproblems. These subproblems can use a combination of interfaces
to various classical and quantum solvers to achieve a higher level of accuracy
for large-scale, practical molecular simulations.

OpenQEMIST provides access to a portion of the functionalities of QEMIST, as
open source software under an Apache 2.0 license. For more information about the
full functionality of QEMIST and obtaining additional information, please
consult our main [product page](https://1qbit.com/qemist).

## Installation
### Installation with pip
The simplest way to install the package is to use pip.

`pip install openqemist`

Before unsing the Microsoft Q# integration, follow the setup [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/?view=qsharp-preview) for installing the .NET Core SDK and the Microsoft IQ# module.

### Installation from source
To install OpenQEMIST from source, simply clone the GitHub repo and add the package
to your ``PYTHONPATH``. The dependencies for running the project are the Microsoft
.NET Core SDK, IQ#, and qsharp packages; pyscf; numpy; and scipy. The most current
list of dependencies, as well as dependencies for building the documentation can
be found in the [Dockerfile](./docker_images/Dockerfile).

## Getting started

To get started install the package, then see the [Jupyter notebooks](./examples/) for example usage.

## Architechture of OpenQEMIST

OpenQEMIST is organized into three layers: problem decomposition, electronic
structure solvers, and hardware backends. The problem decomposition layer is
responsible for splitting the input molecule into smaller subproblems and
submitting these to one (but conceivably more than one) eigenvalue solver, then
processing these results into an output energy. Some electronic structure
solvers use classical methods, while other use wrappers over quantum hardware
emulators from various hardware providers. The quantum solver backend layer
implements a common interface over libraries and emulators of quantum hardware.

Currently DMET is the only implemented problem decomposition.
VQE, FCI, and CCSD are the implemented electronic structure solvers.
